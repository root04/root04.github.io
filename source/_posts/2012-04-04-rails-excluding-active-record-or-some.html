<div  class=post>
  <br>
  I wanted to exclude Active Record in my test app of rails.  <br> <br>
  # I would probably use DB connections in almost every apps I develop, <br>
  # but I didn't want to setup databases for my test app.  <br> <br>
  In order to do this, Mr.Google told me to change below files.  <br> <br>
  <br>
  - config/environments/development.rb <br>
  - config/environments/production.rb <br> <br>
  <br>
  to edit config.frameworks and delete active_record, like below example.  <br> <br>
  - before <br>
    config.frameworks -= [ :active_record, :active_resource, :action_mailer ] <br>
  - after <br> <br>
    config.frameworks -= [ :active_resource, :action_mailer ] <br> <br>
  <br>
  which didn't exist in my development.rb/production.rb files.  <br> <br>
  Next googling took me to the answer.  <br> <br>
  probably, in the former version, above solution was correct.  <br> <br>
  But in the recent version(I don't know from which version)  the solution is below.  <br> <br>
  (refer to http://therailworld.com/posts/27-Disable-ActiveRecord-in-Rails-3) <br> <br>
  File to edit : config/application.rb.  <br> <br>
  - before <br>
    require "rails/all" <br> <br>
  - after <br>
    # require "rails/all"  <- comment out <br> <br>
    # add the lines below and comment out what you don't need <br>
    # Pick the frameworks you want: <br>
    # require "active_record/railtie" <br>
    require "action_controller/railtie" <br>
    require "action_mailer/railtie" <br>
    require "active_resource/railtie" <br>
    require "rails/test_unit/railtie" <br> <br>
  keep in mind that you must exclude configs related to the modules commented out.  <br>
  So, when I comment active_records out, I also commented out some configs in <br>
  config/environment/development.rb and config/application.rb.  <br> <br>
