<div  class=post>
  <h3 >
    Background
  </h3>
  While using devise on rails3, I got the following error message.  <br><br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
    <span  style=font-size: small;>
      Couldn't Find User With Id=sign_in Devise on Rails 3
    </span> </pre>
  It was working yesterday, but not today.  <br> <br>
  <h3 >
    Solution
  </h3>
  I checked config/routes.rb, and had <br><br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
    <span  style=font-size: small;>
      resources :users
      devise_for :users
    </span> </pre>
  which seemed to be interupting each other.  <br>
  So I commented out resources :users, and it started to work fine.  <br>
  I don't know why it kept working till yesterday...  <br>
</div>
