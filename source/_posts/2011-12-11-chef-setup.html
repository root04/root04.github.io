<div  class=post>
  I started here.  <br> <br>
  <a  href=http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation>http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation</a> <br> <br>
  Installed the chef/chef-server via apt.  <br> <br>
  Installation went pretty well, except my laptop hanged while the <br>
  chef-solr installation, and had to delete the rabbitMQ user, after <br>
  the reboot.  <br> <br>
  # rabbitmqctl delete_user chef <br> <br>
  Then, <br> <br>
  # apt-get install chef chef-server <br> <br>
  again.  <br>
  This did it.  <br> <br>
  I'll add some more news later.
