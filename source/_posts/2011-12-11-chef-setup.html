<div class='post'>
  I started here.  <br /> <br />
  
<a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation">http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation</a> <br /> <br />
  Installed the chef/chef-server via apt.  <br /> <br />
  Installation went pretty well, except my laptop hanged while the <br />
  chef-solr installation, and had to delete the rabbitMQ user, after <br />
  the reboot.  <br /> <br />
  # rabbitmqctl delete_user chef <br /> <br />
  Then, <br /> <br />
  # apt-get install chef chef-server <br /> <br />
  again.  <br />
  This did it.  <br /> <br />
  I'll add some more news later.
