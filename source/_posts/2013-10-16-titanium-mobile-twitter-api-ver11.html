  I was implementing twitter API ver1.1 in Titanium Mobile.  <br> <br>
  I really couldn't find a good way to implement ver1.1, <br>
  but I came across tm_twitter_api and oauth.js/sha1.js, <br>
  which seem to have been working quite well for ver1.0.  <br> <br>
  I decided to look into Twitter docs to see how I should implement Oauth on Twitter.  <br> <br>
  reference: <br>
  <a  href=https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter>https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter</a> <br>
  <a  href=https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/3-legged-authorization>https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/3-legged-authorization</a> <br>
  <a  href=https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request>https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request</a> <br> <br>
  there seem to be some steps until I get to tweet or even get a list of my tweet.  <br>
  And Oauth takes part in authorizing a specific application to do those actions.  <br> <br>
  Mere goal for these step are to get an access token to be used at twitter API.  <br> <br>
  <i >
    <b >
      [step1] obtain a request token
    </b>

  <br> <br>
  I need to send a signed message to below URL.  <br>
  (you have to use POST) <br> <br>
  https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token <br> <br>
  method POST with the following data.  <br> <br>
  oauth_consumer_key <br>
  oauth_nonce <br>
  oauth_signature <br>
  oauth_signature_method <br>
  oauth_timestamp <br>
  oauth_version <br> <br>
  How I should generate these values are quoted in below URL.  <br>
  <a  href=https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request>https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/authorizing-request</a> <br> <br>
  I'll probably just use methods from oauth.js.  <br> <br>
  In response to this request, I should be getting these 3 items.  <br>
  oauth_token : request token?  <br>
  oauth_token_secret : ?  <br>
  oauth_callback_confirmed : must check it's value is "true". No idea what it is.  <br>
  Response code must be 200.  <br> <br>
  For verification, I must check that oauth_callback_confirmed == true, <br>
  and save other 2 variables for the next step to be processed.  <br> <br>
  <i >
    <b >
      [step2] redirect user(and authorize the application)
    </b>
  </i>
  <br>
  Direct them to GET <br>
  <a  href=https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize>https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize</a>.  <br>
  In the request, I should pass oauth_token from the response of step1.  <br> <br>
  According to the authorization status, the result will differ in the following manner.  <br> <br>
  status1: if user is signed in on twitter.com, and approved <br>
  They will be immediately authorized and return to the callback URL with a valid Oauth request token.  <br> <br>
  status2: if user is signed in on twitter.com, but not approved <br>
  A request to approve calling application will be shown.  <br>
  After the user approves it, they'll be returning to the callback URL with a valid Oauth request token.  <br> <br>
  status3: if user is not signed in on twitter.com <br>
  They will be prompted to fill in the credential information.  <br>
  After the user sign in, they'll be returning to the callback URL with a valid Oauth request token.  <br> <br>
  In response to this request, the callback_url will receive a request containing the oauth_token and oauth_verifier parameters.  <br>
  And the app should verify that this oauth_token is identical to the one saved in step1.  <br>
  Also it must save these 2 values for the next step.  <br> <br>
  <b >
    <i >
      [step3] get the access token(finally)
    </i>
  </b>
  <br> <br> <br>
  Call POSTÂ  <br>
  <a  href=https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token>https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token</a> .  <br>
  The request must contain oauth_verifier value obtained in step2.  <br>
  Request token must also be passed as oauth_token.  <br> <br>
  <br>
  In response to this, I should receive a response containing oauth_token(which is access token), and oauth_token_secret parameters.  <br> <br>
  These values should be save for later use in the authorized requests to the Twitter API.  <br> <br>
  <br> <br>
  So, this should be it.  <br>
  But I'm not quite sure if I understood everything...  <br>
  I'll check the code in oauth_adopter, and update if I notice any mistakes.  <br>
  (I'm already quite not sure about callback URLs ...) <br> <br>
