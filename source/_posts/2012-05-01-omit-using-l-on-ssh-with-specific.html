<div  class=post>
  <br>
  I wanted to omit specifing a user when I ssh to particular host.  <br> <br>
  $ man ssh_config <br> <br>
  told me to edit ~/.ssh/config like below.  <br> <br>
  $ vi ~/.ssh/config <br> <br>
  Host 192.168.122.* <br>
     User hogehoge <br>
  Host <br> <br>
  <br>
  $ ssh 192.168.122.101 <br>
  hogehoge@192.168.122.101's password: <br> <br>
  That's it.  <br> <br>
</div>
