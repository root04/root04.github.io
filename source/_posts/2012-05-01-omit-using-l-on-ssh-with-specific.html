<div class='post'>

<br />I wanted to omit specifing a user when I ssh to particular host.
<br />
<br />$ man ssh_config
<br />
<br />told me to edit ~/.ssh/config like below.
<br />
<br />$ vi ~/.ssh/config
<br />
<br />Host 192.168.122.*
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;User hogehoge
<br />Host
<br />
<br />
<br />$ ssh 192.168.122.101
<br />hogehoge@192.168.122.101's password:
<br />
<br />That's it.
<br />
<br />
