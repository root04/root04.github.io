  Its not that major problem for everyone, but I think this couldnt be a improvement.  <br> <br>
  I dont know from which version, but rvm started to stop to ask for user input, <br> <br>
  during the installation of ruby.  <br> <br>
  It really sucks cause I have a capistrano script to automatically install everything I need <br> <br>
  on a set of servers.  <br> <br>
  I looked in the code, but there seems to be no workaround for this yet...  <br> <br>
  I guess I would have to become capistrano until it gets fixed...  <br> <br>
