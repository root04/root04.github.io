<div  class=post>
  Tried to open a xml file with XMLEDITOR.NET.  <br> <br>
  And the following error occured.  <br> <br>
  "There is no Unicode byte order mark. Cannot switch to Unicode." <br> <br>
  I checked the xml file, and fixed the line which said, <br> <br>
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?> <br> <br>
    to <br>
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <br>
    wrong <br>
    utf-16 <br>
    correct <br>
    utf-8 <br>
    <br>
    And now I could open it.  <br> <br>
</div>
