    Slow chrome
  </div>
  I've been suffering from quite sluggish response of google chrome installed on ubuntu for quite a while.  <br> <br>
  Today, I've finally got that solved ! Maybe for a while ...  <br> <br>

    Solution !!
  </div>
  Re intall !!!  <br>
  That's it.  <br> <br>
  I didnt really take a note about the version info, but the former chrome definitely had major version of 34.  <br>
  And so does the current one.  <br>
  Before re installation, I've cleared the cache, deleted many bookmarks, which didn't seem to have any effect.  <br> <br>
  But reinstallation worked for me.  <br> <br>
