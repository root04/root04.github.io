<div  class=post>
  it seems like apt-mirror is not downloading everything I need for Oneiric.  <br>
  Why is that ??  <br>
  Well, I dont know the answer yet, but I'm suspicious about "archive.ubuntu.com".  <br> <br>
  Yes, the connection limit, or the traffic shaping, if they have one.  <br>
  That they might have cut my connection, since I'm experiencing a connection loss in rsync from the command line.  <br> <br>
  I'm just checking on this with apt-mirror with ftp.riken.go.jp.  <br>
  Hopefully, I'll get the answer by tomorrow morning.  <br>
  Let's get a nap...

      oops. I think this is my bad.  <br>
      In /etc/apt/mirror.list <br> <br>
      this line here, <br>
      deb-amd64 http://ftp.riken.go.jp/Linux/ubuntu oneiric main restricted universe multiverse <br> <br>
      had to be like this, with debian-installer, I think.  <br>
      deb-amd64 http://ftp.riken.go.jp/Linux/ubuntu oneiric main main/debian-installer restricted restricted/debian-installer universe multiverse <br> <br>
      I'm giving a shot right now.
