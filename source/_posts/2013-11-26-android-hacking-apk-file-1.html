<div  class=post>
  I wanted to look into apk file for it's resource.  <br> <br>
  What I did below.  <br> <br>
  0. install android-sdk <br>
    
  <a  href=http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html target=_blank>download sdk</a>
   and install(set path) <br> <br>
  1. install apktool <br>
    
  <a  href=https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/ target=_blank>download apktool</a>
   and place it somewhere in path. (or set a path to where it's placed) <br> <br>
  2. execute apktool <br> <br>
  <pre  class=prettyprint>
    <br>
      $ apktool d <apkfile>
    <br> <br>
  </pre>
  <br>
  3. look through res directory <br>
    I wanted to see the localization files, so I looked into res/value-XX folders <br> <br>
  That's all for today.
</div>
