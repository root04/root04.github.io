<div  class=post>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    > show variables like "char%";
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    edit my.cnf.
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    [mysqld] <br>
    #character-set-server = latin1 <br>
    #collation-server = latin1_general_ci <br>
    default-character-set=utf8 <br>
    skip-character-set-client-handshake
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    character-set-server defines default character-set.  <br>
    collation-server defines servers default check order for character-set.  <br>
    To tell the truth, I havent had enough understanding for collation-server.  <br>
    I'll write about it again, when I looked it up.  <br>
    I'll have to edit others like, [mysqldump] and [mysql].  <br>
    Just add
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    default-character-set=utf8
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    and finally, I got to set character-set for my CUI.  <br>
    After getting into the mysql console, just type
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    SET NAMES <what ever char-set with your console> <br>
    char-set = cp932(in windows)/utf8(in Linux)
  </p>
  <p  dir=ltr>
    that should be it.
  </p>
  <br>
</div>
