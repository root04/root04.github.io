<div  class=post>
  Its not so easy to keep working on something for long time.ã€€ <br>
  I'm not good at it either.  <br>
  But I always try to keep one thing in mind.  <br>
  If I work on one thing for 30min everyday, <br>
  I'll be ahead of guys that didnt work on it.  <br>
  If I keep on working for a year, <br>
  It will become 180hrs/yr, almost a week ahead.  <br>
  A week/yr might not be enough advantage for many people, <br>
  and if so, stop working. It's a good reason for me.  <br>
  Just a little tips to keep working.  <br>
