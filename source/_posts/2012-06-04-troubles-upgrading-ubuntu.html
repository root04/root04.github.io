<div  class=post>
  Many times I upgrade Ubuntu, my window widgets(titles and side bars) go away.  <br> <br>
  Just a memo on how to recover it.  <br> <br>
  I use compiz and it looks like the compiz configs go away in upgrade procedure.  <br> <br>
  So the first thing I do is, boot compiz configuration manager, <br> <br>
  and check on "Window Decoration".  <br> <br>
  That should do.
