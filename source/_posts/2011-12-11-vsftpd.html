<div  class=post>
  Done setting up vsftpd for PXE.  <br>
  I'm using it to serve preseed file.  <br> <br>
  <ul >
    <li >
      Had to be accessible by anonymous user
    </li>
    <li >
      Needed to set root dir
    </li>
    <li >
      root dir had to be unwritable by anonymous user
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  so, <br> <br>
  anonymous_enable=YES <br>
  no_anon_password=YES <br>
  anon_root=whateverdir <br> <br>
  and <br> <br>
  chmod 555 whateverdir <br> <br>
  thats all I did.  <br> <br>
  By the way, I'm using Natty Narwhal.
</div>
