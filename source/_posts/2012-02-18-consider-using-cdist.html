  Today, I'll write about cdist.  <br> <br>
  It's a configuration management system, like puppet or chef or some others.  <br> <br>
  I think the official website for cdist is 
  <a  href=http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/>here</a>
  , and you could get most of the information there. So just read it(:-) <br> <br>
  First my cdist version is 2.0.7.  <br> <br>
  To check the version, type <br> <br>
  hogehoge@localhost:~/cdist$ cdist -V <br> <br>
  cdist 2.0.7 <br> <br>
  Now to start with, I need a documentation, and the HTML document is handy.  <br>
  It's under ${CDIST}/doc/man/man{1,7} (${CDIST} assumes where you installed cdist) <br>
  Open "cdist-quickstart.html" with chrome or something.  <br>
  And the rest goes to the next blog...  <br>

      Hello.  <br> <br>
      You are always root when doing configuration management on machine. Ssh is considered to be secure and password-less (key based) authentication as well.  <br> <br>
      And if you really want to go a different way, you can use custom remote_exec and remote_copy commands.  <br> <br>
      Cheers, <br> <br>
