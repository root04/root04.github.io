  Today, I'll write about cdist.  <br /> <br />
  It's a configuration management system, like puppet or chef or some others.  <br /> <br />
  I think the official website for cdist is&nbsp;
  <a href="http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/">here</a>
  , and you could get most of the&nbsp;information there. So just read it(:-) <br /> <br />
  First my cdist version is 2.0.7.  <br /> <br />
  To check the version, type <br /> <br />
  hogehoge@localhost:~/cdist$ cdist -V <br /> <br />
  cdist 2.0.7 <br /> <br />
  Now to start with, I need a documentation, and the HTML document is handy.  <br />
  It's under ${CDIST}/doc/man/man{1,7} (${CDIST} assumes where you installed cdist) <br />
  Open "cdist-quickstart.html" with chrome or something.  <br />
  And the rest goes to the next blog...  <br />

      Hello.  <br /> <br />
      You are always root when doing configuration management on machine. Ssh is considered to be secure and password-less (key based) authentication as well.  <br /> <br />
      And if you really want to go a different way, you can use custom remote_exec and remote_copy commands.  <br /> <br />
      Cheers, <br /> <br />
