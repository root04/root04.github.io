<div  class=post>
  $ heroku keys:add <br> <br>
  you would have to watchout since it uploads ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in default(wo an argument).  <br>
  you could specify a key file as an argument.  <br>
  also, be sure to send the file ending with .pub . never send a private key file to others.  <br> <br>
  hit <br> <br>
  $ heroku keys <br> <br>
  in order to show the registered keys.
  <br> <br> <br>
</div>
