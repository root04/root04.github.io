<div  class=post>
  <br>
  I always fail to set the correct keycode when setting key bind for mutt.  <br> <br>
  So some tips I'll leave here.  <br> <br>
  1. boot mutt <br>
  2. in index mode, type following <br> <br>
  :exec what-key <br> <br>
  3. press the key/keys you want to know the keycode for <br> <br>
  4. check the result <br>
  (following example pressed "p") <br> <br>
  Char = p, Octal = 160, Decimal = 112 <br>
  5. set the key binding in muttrc <br>
  that's it.  <br>
</div>
