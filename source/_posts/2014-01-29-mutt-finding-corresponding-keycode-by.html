<div  class=post>
  I always fail to set the correct keycode when setting key bind for mutt.  <br> <br>
  So some tips I'll leave here.  <br> <br>
  <!-- more -->
  <ol>
  <li>
    boot mutt
  </li>
  <li>
    in index mode, type following <br>
    :exec what-key
  </li>
  <li>
    press the key/keys you want to know the keycode for
  </li>
  <li>
    check the result <br>
    (following example pressed "p") <br>
    Char = p, Octal = 160, Decimal = 112
  </li>
  <li>
    set the key binding in muttrc
  </li>
  </ol>
  that's it.  <br>
</div>
