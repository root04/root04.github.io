<div class='post'>
I've written an app for managing external art-designers schedule for my company.<br /><br />The app's written in Ruby on Rails so I decided to use capistrano for deployment.<br /><br />It's been a while since I last used capistrano, and eventually, it had upgraded to version 3.0.0.<br /><br />I'll leave the difference in this blog.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano</a> <br /><a href="http://www.capistranorb.com/">http://www.capistranorb.com/</a><br /><br />1. no capify !!!<br /><br />I got stuck with this.<br />Use cap install instead.<br /><br />2. no deploy:setup !!!<br /><br />It's gone.<br /><br />3.</div>
